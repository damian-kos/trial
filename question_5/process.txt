# Question 5 - Frigo spell
Problem:
    On https://github.com/edubart/otclient
    I experienced an issue where I spells using CONST_ME_ICETORNADO weren't rendering properly on a map.
    It was even happening on clean build.
    Trying to reproduce a behavior of the spell, with  small and big tornados as on trial video, wasn't possible.

How did I manage to overcome a problem:
    I build an OTCv8 from different repository, and CONST_ME_ICETORNADO were rendering better but still not as it should - even on clean builds.
    So I've decided to reporduce the spell on exact same SQM, as it is on trial video. And it worked.
    Went back to https://github.com/edubart/otclient client, and it worked on that SQM as well. However on other SQMs spells using 
    CONST_ME_ICETORNADO are still not consistent.
