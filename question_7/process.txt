# Question 7 
Problem:
    Didn't have any previous experience with modules for otclient. Didn't know how they work.

How did I manage to overcome a problem:
    Got some random module, and reversed it so I'd have minimal example.
    After doing so it was fairly simple to achieve desired result. 
    As it was mainly math calculations, and redirecting a button back to it's position.
    Done it as a module, as most of codebase affecting the client was made similar way.
